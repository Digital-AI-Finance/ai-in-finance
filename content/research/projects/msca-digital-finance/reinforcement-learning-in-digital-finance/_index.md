## Course

 _Date: 03 Feb 2025, 08:30 – 07 Feb 2025, 17:00_  
 _Venue: University of Twente, Ravelijn, Hallenweg 17, 7522 NH Enschede, the Netherlands_

The 4EC doctoral training course "Reinforcement Learning in Digital Finance" offers a comprehensive exploration of reinforcement learning (RL), which is a powerful framework to support sequential decision-making under uncertainty.

Candidates will delve into the theoretical foundations of reinforcement learning, state-of-the-art algorithms, and practical applications within the digital finance domain. RL can facilitate and enhance sequential decision-making processes and services in finance, such as algorithmic trading, portfolio optimization, risk management, and fraud detection. Doctoral candidates will gain a solid understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of RL as well as practical experience in implementing reinforcement learning algorithms to solve real-world financial problems. The applications will consider constraints and regulations that concern privacy, algorithmic bias, and explainability.  
By the end of the course, candidates will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to leverage reinforcement learning for optimizing control, enhancing performance, and improving services in the dynamic landscape of digital finance.

**Warren B. Powell** is Professor Emeritus at Princeton University, where he taught for 39 years, and is currently the Chief Innovation Officer at Optimal Dynamics. He was the founder and director of CASTLE Lab, which focused on stochastic optimization with applications to freight transportation, energy systems, health, e-commerce, finance and the laboratory sciences, supported by over $50 million in funding from government and industry. He has pioneered a new universal framework that can be used to model any sequential decision problem, including the identification of four classes of policies that spans every possible method for making decisions. This is documented in his latest book with John Wiley: Reinforcement Learning and Stochastic Optimization: A unified framework for sequential decisions.
