  * Sebastian Goldmann

Sebastian continued to work at ING. ING utilized the techniques developed within his thesis to challenge and refine their model development methodology. Specifically, his thesis investigated and enhanced new feature design using the transactional data of retail customers to predict their probability of default. His work improved the predictive power of the model, potentially resulting in fewer defaulting clients.

  * Thomas Koene

In the master thesis titled "How to effectively implement the HRDD aspect of the CSDDD in financial institutions?", Thomas explores effective strategies for integrating HRDD processes within financial institutions to comply with the CSDDD. The 7-step action research model from Warner Burke is used as a basis. This is combined with a systematic literature review and semi-structured interviews to come to a best practice & recommendation model.

  * Leixin Zhang

Leixin Zhang is a PhD Candidate at the University of Twente. The aim is to apply her research to real-world use-cases within ING's Wholesale Banking Advanced Analytics department. ING has a RAG setup where they need to extract answers to a set of questions from a large set of documents. The intern will be asked to study the latest research developments on confidence scores for LLMs, adjust it where needed for application to our practical use-cases, and define and build a hands-on prototype.

The Wholesale Banking Advanced Analytics team is a large team of data scientists, data engineers, software developers and many more, that are focused on bringing data, machine learning and statistical modeling into the products that we build for our clients or internal users. The data scientists in WBAA furthermore have a strong desire to keep up with and be part of the latest developments in the fields of AI, tooling and statistics. Which they do by working closely together with master’s students on a variety of topics to solve academic yet practical problems.
