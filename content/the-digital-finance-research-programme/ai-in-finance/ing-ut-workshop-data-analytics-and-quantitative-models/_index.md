The European AI Act prescribes that AI-driven operations should be transparent, therefore requiring that banks are able to explain AI-driven decisions. Deep Reinforcement Learning is a powerful decision-making paradigm that increasingly finds its way to practice, but the explainability of this class of machine learning is still in its infancy. This presentation gives a quick overview of the state of the art and reflects on the challenges and potential directions for Explainable Reinforcement Learning.
