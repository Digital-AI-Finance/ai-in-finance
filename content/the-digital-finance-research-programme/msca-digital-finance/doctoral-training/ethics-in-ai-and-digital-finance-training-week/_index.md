Lecturer:****[**Renata Guizzardi**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renataguizzardi/)(University of Twente).  
As systems increasingly impact societal norms, ensuring ethicality in their design and implementation has become a critical concern. This course explores the foundational principles, methods, and frameworks for eliciting and analyzing ethicality requirements in technology-driven projects. Students will engage with interdisciplinary perspectives, including ethics, engineering, and behavioral science, to understand the complexities of translating abstract ethical principles into actionable system requirements.Key topics include stakeholder identification, the role of biases in ethical decision-making, regulatory and compliance considerations, and techniques for managing ethical trade-offs in system design. Through case studies, practical exercises, and collaborative projects, participants will develop skills to systematically capture ethical concerns and integrate them into the requirements engineering process.

Lecturer:****[**Stefan Theußl**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefan-theussl/)(Research Innovation Hub of Raiffeisen Research at RBI Group).  
In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI and digital finance, ethical considerations are paramount for financial analysts. This talk delves into the core ethical principles outlined by the EFFAS Principle of Ethical Conduct [1], as well as the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct [2], emphasizing the imperative to act with integrity, competence, diligence, and respect. Financial analysts are called to prioritize the interests of clients and the integrity of the investment profession above personal gains, exercising independent professional judgment and promoting ethical behavior. These principles become increasingly crucial as analysts begin to interact with AI technologies, both as tools for drafting assessments and as interfaces for client engagement.

Lecturer:[**Wolfgang Karl Härdle**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wolfgang-karl-h%C3%A4rdle-499739287/)****(Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin)  
In an increasingly digitalized world, the demand for actionable insights from data has never been greater. Yet, paradoxically, we find ourselves in a society where mathematical literacy is often sidelined in favor of intuitive, user-friendly interfaces. This talk explores how data science can thrive in a “mathless” digital society, where the emphasis shifts from technical expertise to accessibility and democratization. We will examine the role of automation, machine learning, and no-code tools in bridging the gap between complex algorithms and practical decision-making. Case studies will illustrate how these advancements empower individuals and organizations to harness the power of data without requiring deep mathematical knowledge. The talk also addresses the risks of oversimplification and the need for ethical frameworks to guide the responsible use of data-driven technologies.

Lecturer: [**Xiaohong Huang**](https://people.utwente.nl/x.huang)(University of Twente)  
Cognitive biases, the systematic deviations from rational decision-making, shape human judgment and behavior in profound ways. As artificial intelligence and machine learning systems increasingly influence critical decision-making processes, understanding how these biases manifest in machines is essential. This course delves into the origins, mechanisms, and impacts of cognitive biases, exploring their transition from human cognition to algorithmic design and application.Students will examine key cognitive biases such as anchoring, confirmation bias, and availability heuristics, investigating their implications for human behavior and the risks they pose when embedded in AI systems. Topics include bias detection and mitigation strategies, the interplay between biased data and algorithms, and the ethical considerations of designing bias-aware systems. Case studies from diverse fields such as healthcare, finance, and social media will provide real-world context to theoretical insights.

The AI Act is a significant piece of legislation aimed at regulating artificial intelligence (AI) within the European Union. It establishes a comprehensive legal framework to ensure the development and deployment of AI systems are safe, transparent, and aligned with fundamental rights. The Act categorizes AI systems based on risk levels, with stricter regulations for high-risk applications and bans on those deemed unacceptable, such as social scoring by governments.14:00 – 15:30 Lunch BreakVisit to Oradea Musem
  * 15:40 – 16:30 Implications and future scenarios about the use of GenAI in banking and society.  
Lecturer:****[**Renato Rocha Souza**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renato-rocha-souza-157153/)(Research Innovation Hub of Raiffeisen Research at RBI Group)  
The presentation will cover an introduction to large language models (LLMs), highlighting their capabilities and the transformative potential they hold for various industries. We will briefly discuss the concept of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the future scenarios it might enable, emphasizing the profound societal changes that could arise. Additionally, we will explore the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) to revolutionize creative industries, content generation, and personalized experiences. We will address the pervasive issue of biases in LLMs and their ethical ramifications. As AI systems become increasingly integrated into various sectors, the biases inherent in LLMs can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. We will examine the sources of these biases, including training data and algorithmic design, and their potential impacts on marginalized communities. By fostering a dialogue on responsible AI practices, we aim to raise awareness and promote the creation of more equitable and trustworthy AI systems.

As we look ahead, the AI enabled future is not anymore about tech, or STEM as we used to know them. It is about creativity, about shaping the technologies for their best of use. Education plays a key role in this transformation. By encouraging young women, or experienced professionals to thrive using these tools, we can ensure that technologies of tomorrow embed diverse needs, perspectives and enable deeper expertise.
  * 17:30 – 18:30 Ethical Boundary in AI-Based Risk and Scoring Models in retail banking industry – study case.
