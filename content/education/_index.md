> Education is at the heart of advancing AI in finance. Our project not only bridges the gap between theoretical research and practical application but also equips the next generation of professionals with the necessary skills and knowledge to innovate and drive ethical AI solutions in the financial industry.

M. Machado, Dr.

The objective is to enhance AI education by incorporating practical financial applications into both the curriculum and research initiatives. This approach provides students with direct experience with advanced technologies. Furthermore, the goal is to create an environment where academic research and industry practices merge, allowing students to undertake guided projects. These projects aim to tackle present-day finance sector challenges with new AI-based approaches.

## Exposing Students to Industry

As part of the course 'Information Systems for the Financial Services Industry' over 50 students were invited to the headquarters of ING, located in Amsterdam, to participate in workshop on **Data Analytics** and **Quantitative Models** in **Banking and Academia**.
