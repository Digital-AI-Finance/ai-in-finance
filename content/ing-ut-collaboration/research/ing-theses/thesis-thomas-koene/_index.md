Koene, Thomas (2025). Navigating Human Rights Due Diligence in Financial Institutions: Creating A Roadmap for Implementation

## Abstract

This research investigates how financial institutions (FIs) can effectively implement Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) on their direct business partners. Both the downstream and up stream part of the value chain is covered. A systematic literature review (SLR) is used to com bine the existing academic and gray literature on the HRDD process, the CSDDD and its key parts, current guidelines and frameworks, and the Action Research Model by Warner Burke. ComplementingtheSLR,theresearch utilizes a mixed-method approach featuring semi struc tured interviews (SSIs) with industry experts from a leading financial institution, from now on Company X. Empirical data reveals challenges, opportunities and best-practices for both im plementing HRDDandperformingHRDDitself. Theresults show the necessity of clear defini tions, stakeholder engagement, standardization of processes, and integration with existing risk and compliance systems. Drawing on the Action Research Model by Warner Burke, the study develops a roadmap that provides a high-level, step-by-step guide to HRDD implementation ondirect business partners, thereby bridging theory and practice.
