## Collaboration in Research

### Research by UT Students

The collaboration has yielded 8 successfully completed Master's theses, and one is presently underway. The topics range from Explainable AI (XAI), AI models for Early Warning Systems (EWS), AI models for credit risk assessment, incorporating ESG factors in credit rating, and improving automated information extraction from sustainability reports.

Additionally, PhD Candidate Leixin Zhang's research on obtaining a reliable confidence scores for generated answers with LLMs in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The project aligns with the broader initiatives of multiple Generative AI projects within ING Bank, aimed at extracting data from vast quantities of documents.
